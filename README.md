## Decription

This week challenge is create a professional readme using node.js.
A command-line application that generates a professional README file from the user's input using the Inquirer package. A command-line application will allow for a quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
Ensure that node.js and npm are installed. The steps to use this appllication:
clone the repository, 
Run npm init, 
Run npm i inquirer,
Run node.index.js,
When the application starts, answer each prompt or leave blank and when all the questions are answered, a file named 'generatedREADME.md' will be generated within the local folder.

Video link has been provided for users to follow the instructions and generate Readme.md file.
